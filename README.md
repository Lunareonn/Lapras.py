  <b>Lapras.py</b>
  <br>
  <sup><sub>Bot written in discord.py (duh)</sub></sup>
</h1>

### Features
- Basic moderation
- Macros
- Actionlogs/Modlogs
- Automatic role assignment for new members
- Competitive Team Fortress 2 roster availability check

**This bot is still very much a Work In Progress. Further functionality will be added as I work on the project.**

## Notes

- As of 6/11/2024, the bot is **NOT** made for use across multiple servers.
- The current database system is very bad, I'm aware. I'm working on a database rewrite over on the [db-rewrite](https://github.com/Lunareonn/Lapras.py/tree/db-rewrite) branch.
